# CSKoth Plugin

  A King of the Hill (KOTH) plugin for Minecraft Purpur 1.21.4 servers.

## Features

- Create and manage multiple KOTH zones
- Customizable capture times and points
- Real-time tracking of player captures
- Reward system for successful captures
- Admin commands to manage KOTH events
- Player leaderboard system
- Integration with economy plugins (via server commands)

## Installation
  
  1. Download the CSKoth.jar file
  2. Place it in your server's `plugins` folder
  3. Restart your server
  4. The plugin will generate default configuration files
  
  ## Configuration
  
  ### Main Configuration (config.yml)
  
  ```yaml
# Default capture time in seconds
default-capture-time: 300

# Default points awarded for capturing a KOTH
default-capture-points: 1

# Commands to execute when a player captures a KOTH
# Available placeholders: %player%, %koth%
rewards:
  - 'give %player% diamond 5'
  - 'eco give %player% 1000'
  ```
  
  ### KOTH Zones (koths.yml)
  
  This file is automatically managed by the plugin, but can be manually edited if needed.

## Commands

### Admin Commands

- `/cskoth create <name>` - Start creating a new KOTH zone
- `/cskoth finalize <name>` - Finalize KOTH zone creation
- `/cskoth delete <name>` - Delete a KOTH zone
- `/cskoth start <name>` - Start a KOTH event
- `/cskoth stop <name>` - Stop a KOTH event
- `/cskoth list` - List all available KOTH zones

### Player Commands

- `/cskoth points [name]` - View points for a specific KOTH or all KOTHs

## Permissions

- `cskoth.use` - Allows access to basic commands (default: true)
- `cskoth.admin` - Allows access to administrative commands (default: op)

## How It Works
  
  1. Admins create KOTH zones using the selection tool
  2. When a KOTH event is started, players can enter the defined zone
  3. If a single player remains in the zone, they begin capturing
  4. The player must stay in the zone for the specified capture time
  5. When successfully captured, the player receives rewards and points
  6. If multiple players enter the zone, it becomes contested until only one remains

## Customization

- Configure custom rewards in config.yml
- Adjust capture times per KOTH zone
- Set different point values for different zones
- Integrate with other plugins via the reward command system
